## Using PCA for Genome Analysis

This work focused on applying PCA to reduce dimensions for genome analysis. The original dataset is (995x10103). Here I explored with at most first 4 principal components and related knowledge domain. Codes are explained in ipynb file, please feel free to check it out.

### Using Principal Component 1 and Principal Component 2 for analysis
