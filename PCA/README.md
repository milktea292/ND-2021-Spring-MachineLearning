## Using PCA for Genome Analysis

This work focused on applying PCA to reduce dimensions for genome analysis. The size of the original dataset is (995 rows Ã— 10104 columns). Here I explored with at most the first 4 principal components and geographic knowledge domain. Codes are explained in ipynb file, please feel free to check it out.
